# Claude Code Provider Switcher

PowerShell scripts for switching [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) between API providers — Anthropic's native API and GLM-5 via Z.AI.

## Why

Claude Code reads its configuration from `~\.claude\settings.json`. These scripts swap that file between pre-configured profiles so you can quickly toggle providers without manual editing.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `claude-anthropic.ps1` | Switch to the **Anthropic** profile (default Claude models) |
| `claude-glm.ps1` | Switch to the **GLM** profile (GLM-5 models via Z.AI) |
| `claude-status.ps1` | Display the currently active profile and its configuration |

### `claude-anthropic.ps1`

Backs up your current `settings.json` to `settings-backup.json`, then copies `settings-anthropic.json` into place. If no Anthropic settings file exists yet, it creates a minimal default.

### `claude-glm.ps1`

Backs up your current `settings.json` to `settings-backup.json`, then copies `settings-glm.json` into place. If no GLM settings file exists yet, it creates one pre-configured for the Z.AI endpoint with GLM-5 mapped to all three model slots (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku).

> **Note:** The generated default uses a placeholder API key (`ADD-ZAI-TOKEN-HERE`). Replace it with your actual Z.AI token before use.

### `claude-status.ps1`

Reads `settings.json` and detects the active profile by checking for a Z.AI base URL. Displays the profile name, API endpoint, and configured model names.

## Setup

1. **Place profile files** in `~\.claude\`:
   - `settings-anthropic.json` — your Anthropic configuration
   - `settings-glm.json` — your Z.AI / GLM configuration

2. **Add the scripts to your PATH** (e.g. copy them to `~\.local\bin\`) so they can be called by name from any directory.

3. **Run a switcher** to activate a profile:

   ```powershell
   claude-anthropic   # switch to Anthropic
   claude-glm         # switch to GLM / Z.AI
   claude-status      # check which profile is active
   ```

## File Layout

```
~\.claude\
├── settings.json            # active config (managed by the scripts)
├── settings-backup.json     # auto-created backup of the previous profile
├── settings-anthropic.json  # Anthropic profile
└── settings-glm.json        # GLM / Z.AI profile
```

## Requirements

- Windows PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell 7+
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed
